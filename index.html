                                <p >  During the colonization of the Dutch Coromandel coast, the Dutch East India Company maintained a trading post known as Jaggernaikpoeram or Jaggernaickpuram (among other spellings) to the English.
                                    The British established the site in 1759 as a shipbuilding and ship repair facility. The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river. As the principal seaport on this coast, it soon became a large shipbuilding yard of some importance. In 1802 a dock was built for repair of the Royal Navy and other vessels; it boasted the only wet dock between Bombay and Calcutta. ‘'Cape Cori, or Hope Island as it was called, was known internationally for shipbuilding and repairs.] The facilities were destroyed by massive cyclonic storms and tidal waves in 1787 (causing 20,000 fatalities) and again on 9 and 10 May 1832.On 25 November 1839 yet another even greater cyclone finished off the port and it was not to recover. It has been estimated that the storm surge was as much as 40 feet. The harbour city was destroyed as were some
                                     20,000 vessels of various sizes. This was one of the storms cited by Henry Piddington in a speech to the ‘'Asiatic Society of Bengal'’ where he first used the term ‘'cyclone'’ to describe the phenomena.[14] After the 1839 cyclone, homes were relocated further inland.
                                    In 1901 due to sand depositing, and silting of the estuary not a single ship of any consequence could enter the port, by 1905 the construction of ships had ceased, and the port was closed.
                                    In the Madras Presidency, the District of Rajahmundry was created in 1823. It was reorganised in 1859 and was bifurcated into Godavari and Krishna districts. During British rule, Rajahmundry was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari district was divided, Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari and Eluru became headquarters of West Godavari.

                        <p> The town's history dates from 230 BCE with the era of the Mauryas and Satavahanas who ruled most of
                            what is now Andhra Pradesh. A few inscriptions dating to the Satavahana period have been found in 
                            the village China Ganjam, near Ongole. After the Satavahanas, this place came into the limelight 
                            again during the Kakatiya dynasty, when the nearby towns of Motupalli and VodaRevu served as major 
                            seaports. Ongole is also mentioned in the inscriptions of the Pallava rulers of the 3rd and 4th century A.D.
                           The city was also ruled by Krishna Deva Raya. The last dynasty to rule the Ongole region before the
                            British was the Mandapati dynasty (zamindars). According to the historical inscriptions available at Sri 
                            Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Temple complex in Ongole City was constructed by Cholas. Kaasi Visweswara Swamy 
                            temple, Chennakesava Swamy Temple and Veeranjaneya Swamy temple were built in the early 17th century by 
                            King Vankayalapati mantri and Army Chief.
                           Ongole district came into existence on 02-02-1970 with the carving out portions of Markapur revenue 
                           division from Kurnool, Ongole revenue division from Guntur and Kandukur revenue division from Nellore 
                           districts. It was renamed as Prakasam district in 1972 in memory of the eminent freedom fighter, later 
                           Chief Minister of the composite Madras State and the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh State, late
