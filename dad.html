    temple, Chennakesava Swamy Temple and Veeranjaneya Swamy temple were built in the early 17th century by
    King Vankayalapati mantri and Army Chief.
    Ongole district came into existence on 02-02-1970 with the carving out portions of Markapur revenue
    division from Kurnool, Ongole revenue division from Guntur and Kandukur revenue division from Nellore
    districts. It was renamed as Prakasam district in 1972 in memory of the eminent freedom fighter, later
    Chief Minister of the composite Madras State and the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh State, late
    Andhra Kesari Sri Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu, who was born at Vinodarayuni palem, a hamlet of Kanuparthi
